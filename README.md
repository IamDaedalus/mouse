# MOUSE-83

## What is Mouse?
Mouse is small and efficient microcontroller programming language developed the
late 70s by Professor Peter Grogono. It was developed as an extension for an earlier
digital and analogue device controller language know as *MUSYS*.  
Mouse is an interpreted and stack based language which is composed of various
symbols that act as operators for several predefined functions. Being interpreted
Mouse is evaluated as a stream of characters onto a virtual stack machine that
process commands and operators in a first in last out manner which means it is
up to the user to construct commands in a way to fit the stack style.
